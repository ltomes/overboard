synopsis: "Construct a minimal DFA that recognizes a list of words."
description:
  "Implements a minimal deterministic finite-state acyclic automaton that recognizes a finite set of words and perfect hashing. It works with a 8 bits alphabet and treat words as byte strings. It is ideal for natural language dictionaries that are constructed once and compiled into a compact representation."
